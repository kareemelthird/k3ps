/**
 * Reports — pure time/range helpers for the Phase 6 owner dashboard (ADR-0007).
 *
 * The dashboard selects a range of **business-day keys** (`'YYYY-MM-DD'`,
 * `businessDayKey`, ADR-0006 Decision 1 / ADR-0007 Decision 3) and the SQL
 * reporting RPCs filter rows on a half-open UTC instant window. These helpers
 * own that key→window conversion so the boundary math has ONE source of truth:
 * `businessDayRange` here and `businessDayKey` agree by construction, which is
 * the load-bearing parity property the SQL labels are tested against.
 *
 * HARD RULES (CLAUDE.md §2.4, §4):
 *   - Pure: instants are derived from the keys, never read from the system
 *     clock. Same input -> same output.
 *   - No React / RN / Expo / Next / Supabase imports — dayjs (tz) only, reused
 *     from the time module so the utc/timezone plugins are loaded once.
 *   - No money math here (the piastre sums live in SQL — ADR-0007 Decision 5).

 * (a cutover-6 business day starts at 06:00 local). `toIso` is the start of the
